Meteor server application that launches a Famous Framework application using a DDP 
protocol component that connects back to the server. The Framework app is a simple Chat 
scroll list that demonstrates the use of DDP to 'watch' Meteor collections and update it's data in real time.


Clone this into a new folder. Start the Meteor server ($meteor).

Launch the Framework application by using the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:3000/ddp/

Launch the Meteor application by going to http://localhost:3000.

Change or add items from either application and watch the other one update in real time via DDP.


Enjoy!
